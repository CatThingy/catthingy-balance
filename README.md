# CatThingy's Balance Mod

A highly opinionated mod that makes several tweaks to Minecraft's gameplay, with the intent to increase player
decisions.

## Changes
- Elytra + firework flight speed greatly reduced (>30 b/s to ~15 b/s)
- Crossbow generally buffed and/or reworked:
    - Multishot fires in a much tighter spread. Arrows hitting enemies in quick succession deal 50% damage instead of 0%
    - Crossbows can now be enchanted with Flame, Punch, and Infinity
      - Punch + Piercing crossbows do not apply bonus knockback when the arrows have been shielded
- Bows enhanced:
    - Arrows are only get full damage when releasing an arrow within 0.5s after being fully charged
       - This is a 20% damage nerf vs. previous crit arrows
    - Crit arrows are only achieved by releasing an arrow within .1s after being fully charged
       - This is a 25% damage buff vs previous crit arrows
- Protection enchantment reworked:
    - Protection only applies to damage sources not covered by the other protection enchantments
    - Protection does not apply to things that ignore armour
    - Protection is now twice as effective, bringing it in line with the other enchantments
- Magic Protection enchantment added:
    - Same as the protection enchantments, just only applicable to damage sources considered magic
- Anvil item repairs are much cheaper (xp-wise) and do not cause anvil prices to increase.
    - Netherite tools/armour are now repaired with diamonds instead of netherite ingots
    - Netherite tools/armour can be repaired with diamond tools/armour
    - Tridents can now be repaired with prismarine crystals or shards

- Anvil unit repair restores 33.3% of durability instead of 25%.
- Durability globally increased by 50%.
- Fishing rods do not take increased durability damage from hooking in entities
- Snowballs knock back players
- Smite and Fire Aspect reworked
    - Smite is a slightly less effective Sharpness, but deals its bonus damage as magic damage, ignoring armour
    - Fire Aspect deals bonus armour-ignoring fire damage when hitting flaming targets in addition to its standard effect.
    - Fire Aspect levels go up to 5.
    - Fire Aspect duration reduced from 4s per level to 1s per level
    - Fire Aspect is now incompatible with Sharpness/Smite/Bane of Arthropods
- Firework damage is now based on the firework star
    - Large ball fireworks deal damage in a larger radius
    - Star fireworks deal more damage in a smaller radius
    - Other fireworks remain unchanged
- Thorns reworked
    - Only one level of thorns exists
    - Thorns is no longer random
    - Thorns does not deal knockback
